# Accident Severity Classifier

This repository has the code I used to train and evaluate the Accident Severity Classification models.

## Important Note
The trained model files (`.pkl`) are in the zip folder and the dataset files are not included in this repository because they exceed GitHub’s file size limit.

- The **dataset files** are available through the Google Drive link provided in the final report.

## How to Run
1. Download the dataset files from the Google Drive link in the final report.
2. Place all dataset files in the same directory as the code files.
3. Run the scripts normally.
